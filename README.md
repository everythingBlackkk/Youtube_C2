pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib google-auth rsa
```

## Configuration

Before using the tool, you need to:

1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the YouTube Data API v3
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Download the `client_secrets.json` file
5. Set your YouTube API key and video ID in the script
6. Generate an RSA key pair and update the public key in the script

> **Note:** In the **OAuth Consent Screen**:
